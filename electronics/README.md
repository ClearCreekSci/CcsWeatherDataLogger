# Weather Data Logger Electronics

This document contains information for obtaining, configuring and connecting the electronics in the Clear Creek Scientific Weather Station. We suggest you read through each of the steps below and then work through the steps in the order given. Note that setting up the Raspberry Pi Zero with an operating system requires a separate computer for copying the image to a micro SD card and optionally configuring settings on the Raspberry Pi. Under the section labeled "How to Setup the Raspberry Pi", please select the link to the operating system running on the computer you intend to use.
